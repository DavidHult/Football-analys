# Football-analys
I have chosen to analyze international football games for a school project.
I chose this because i like to play and to analyze football games so i can try and predict the outcomes.
This dataset includes 4 diffrent csv files but i have only analyzed 3 of them because the 4th is only former names of countries.
The things i have focused on are the difference in how many golas are scored in todays games compared to how many goles were scored in the first 1000 games ever played. 
I have compared the top scorers in international football including and exclding penalties. 
What country has the highest win % and what countries has the lowest win %
